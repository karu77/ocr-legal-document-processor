    -   **Windows**: [Download and install from UB Mannheim](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki). **Ensure you add it to your system's PATH.**
    -   **macOS**: `brew install tesseract`
    -   **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`
-   **Poppler**: Required for PDF processing.
    -   **Windows**: [Download Poppler for Windows](https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/), unzip, and add the `bin` directory to your PATH.
    -   **macOS**: `brew install poppler`
    -   **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt-get install poppler-utils`

### Automated Setup (Recommended)

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Run the Setup Script**:
    ```bash
    python setup.py
    ```
    This script will:
    -   ‚úÖ Install all backend and frontend dependencies
    -   ‚úÖ Create a `.env` file from the `env.example` template
    -   ‚úÖ Set up PWA service worker and manifest files
    -   ‚úÖ Configure responsive design assets

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

After installation, configure your environment by editing the `.env` file.

1.  **Choose your AI Engine**:
    -   `USE_LOCAL_NLP=true`: Uses local, offline processing. Free and private. (Default)
    -   `USE_LOCAL_NLP=false`: Uses the Google Gemini API for the highest quality results.

2.  **Add API Keys (if using AI services)**:
    -   To enable Gemini, set `USE_LOCAL_NLP=false` and add your key:
        ```
        GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
        ```
    -   To enable high-quality translations with Hugging Face, add your token:
        ```
        HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=your_huggingface_api_token_here
        ```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### General Issues

-   **"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'utils'" on startup**: Ensure you are running the `start-dev.bat` or `start-dev.sh` scripts from the project's root directory. These scripts set the correct environment for the application to run.
-   **"Tesseract not found" or "Poppler not found"**: Double-check that you have installed these dependencies and that their locations are included in your system's PATH. You may need to restart your terminal or computer for the changes to take effect.
-   **Errors during setup**: Run `python check-system.py` for a detailed diagnostic report.

### Mobile-Specific Issues

#### **PWA Installation Problems**
```bash
# Ensure HTTPS or localhost
# Check manifest.json is accessible
# Verify service worker is registered
```

#### **Touch Interactions Not Working**
```bash
# Check touch-action CSS properties
# Verify touch event handlers are properly attached
# Test on actual devices, not just browser emulation
```

#### **Mobile Performance Issues**
```bash
# Check bundle size
npm run analyze

# Optimize images and assets
npm run optimize

# Monitor performance
npm run lighthouse
```

#### **Offline Functionality Not Working**
```bash
# Check service worker registration
# Verify cache is populated
# Test with network disabled in dev tools
```

### Performance Optimization

#### **"Tesseract not found"**
```bash
# Windows: Download from UB Mannheim
# https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

# macOS:
brew install tesseract

# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
```

#### **Slow Performance**
```bash
# Check your system performance
python benchmark.py

# Optimize settings in .env
MAX_TEXT_LENGTH_TRANSLATION=2000
MAX_CHUNKS_PER_OPERATION=3

# Consider GPU acceleration or Gemini API
```

#### **Memory Issues**
```bash
# Reduce text processing limits
MAX_TEXT_LENGTH_CLEANUP=1500
MAX_TEXT_LENGTH_SUMMARY=2000

# Close other applications
# Consider upgrading RAM
```

#### **Port Conflicts**
```bash
# If ports 3000 or 5000 are in use:
# Kill existing processes or change ports in:
# - frontend/vite.config.js (frontend port)
# - backend/app.py (backend port)
```
